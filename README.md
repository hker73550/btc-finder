# BTC Finder: A High-Performance Bitcoin Address Scanner

## Overview

BTC Finder is a sophisticated Python-based tool designed to generate random 256-bit private keys, compute their corresponding public addresses, and match these addresses against a pre-compiled "rich list" of known addresses with significant balances. This tool leverages advanced cryptographic algorithms and efficient address generation techniques to provide a robust solution for exploring the vast Bitcoin address space.

## Features

- **256-Bit Private Key Generation**: Utilizes a secure random number generator to create private keys that conform to the 256-bit standard used in Bitcoin.
- **Public Address Computation**: Efficiently derives public addresses from the generated private keys using the secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography.
- **Rich List Matching**: Compares computed addresses against a rich list database containing addresses with significant Bitcoin holdings.
- **High-Performance Execution**: Optimized for speed and performance, enabling rapid scanning and matching operations.
- **Modular Design**: Built with a modular architecture to allow easy integration of additional features and enhancements.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Compatible with major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**: Ensure Python is installed and added to your PATH.
- **pip**: Python package installer.

### Clone the Repository

```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

Run the BTC Finder with the following command:

```sh
python btc_finder.py
```

### Configuration

Edit the `config.yaml` file to customize the behavior of BTC Finder. This includes settings for the rich list file path, number of keys to generate per run, and logging preferences.

```yaml
richlist:
  file: path/to/richlist.txt
keygen:
  count: 1000
log:
  level: INFO
```

### Example Run

```sh
python btc_finder.py --config config.yaml
```
